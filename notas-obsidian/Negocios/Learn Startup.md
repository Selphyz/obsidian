# **Key Insights from *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries**  

### **1. Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop**  
   - **Cycle**: Quickly build a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**, measure customer response, and learn to pivot or persevere.  
   - **Goal**: Validate assumptions before scaling.  

### **2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**  
   - Launch the **simplest version** of your product to test hypotheses.  
   - Example: Dropbox started with a demo video to gauge interest.  

### **3. Validated Learning**  
   - Use **data-driven experiments** (not opinions) to test business ideas.  
   - Metrics > Vanity metrics (focus on actionable insights).  

### **4. Pivot or Persevere**  
   - **Pivot**: Change strategy based on feedback (e.g., product, customer segment).  
   - **Persevere**: Double down if the data supports growth.  

### **5. Innovation Accounting**  
   - Measure progress with **actionable metrics** (e.g., conversion rates, not just downloads).  
   - Set up **A/B testing** to compare different versions.  

### **6. Continuous Deployment**  
   - Release updates **frequently** to accelerate learning.  
   - Common in tech (e.g., Facebook’s daily updates).  

### **7. Small Batches Reduce Waste**  
   - Avoid overbuilding—launch small, iterate fast.  
   - Example: Zappos tested demand by selling shoes before stocking inventory.  

### **8. Customer Development**  
   - **Get out of the building**—talk to customers early and often.  
   - Steve Blank’s mantra: "No business plan survives first contact with customers."  

### **9. Engine of Growth**  
   - Three types:  
     1. **Sticky** (retention-focused).  
     2. **Viral** (word-of-mouth driven).  
     3. **Paid** (scaling via advertising).  

### **10. Fail Fast, Learn Faster**  
   - Embrace **experimentation** over perfection.  
   - Failure is a **learning tool**, not defeat.  

### **Bonus: The 5 Whys**  
   - Root-cause analysis: Ask "why?" five times to uncover core problems.
